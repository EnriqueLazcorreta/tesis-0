Compute $\mathcal{T}^*$, the set of ancestors of each item, from $\mathcal{T}$ // Optimization 2
$L_1 := \{$frequent 1-itemsets$\}$;
$k:=2$ // $k$ represents the pass number
while ($\aprioriL[k-1] \neq \emptyset$) do begin
	$\aprioriC := $ New candidates of size $k$ generated from $\aprioriL[k-1]$;
	if ($k = 2$) then // Optimization 3
		Delete any candidate in $\aprioriC[2]$ that consists of an item and its ancestor;
	Delete any ancestors in $\mathcal{T}^*$ that are not present in any of the candidates
    in $\aprioriC$ // Optimization 1
	forall transactions $t\in \D$ do begin
    forall item $x \in t$ do
      Add all ancestors of $x$ in $\mathcal{T}^*$ to $t$;
    Remove any duplicates from $t$;
		Increment the count of all candidates in $\aprioriC$ that are contained in $t$;
	end
	$\aprioriL[k] := $ All candidates in $\aprioriC$ with minimum support;
	$k := k+1$;
end
Answer $:=\bigcup_k{\aprioriL[k]}$;
