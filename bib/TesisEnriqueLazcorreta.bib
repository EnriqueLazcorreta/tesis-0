	Abstract = {We present our perspective of database mining as the confluence of machine learning techniques and the performance emphasis of database technology. We describe three classes of database mining problems involving classification, associations, and sequences, and argue that these problems can be uniformly viewed as requiring discovery of rules embedded in massive data. We describe a model and some basic operations for the process of rule discovery. We show how the database mining problems we consider map to this model and how they can be solved by using the basic operations we propose. We give an example of an algorithm for classification obtained by combining the basic rule discovery operations. This algorithm not only is efficient in discovering classification rules but also has accuracy comparable to ID3, one of the current best classifiers.},

@inproceedings{OzelGuvenir_AnAlgorithmForMining_2001,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an algorithm for finding frequent itemsets in transaction databases. The basic idea of our algorithm is inspired from the Direct Hashing and Pruning (DHP) algorithm, which is in fact a variation of the well-known Apriori algorithm. In the DHP algorithm, a hash table is used in order to reduce the size of the candidate $k+1$ itemsets generated at each step. The difference of our algorithm is that, it uses perfect hashing in order to create a hash table for the candidate $k+1$ itemsets. As perfect hashing is used, the hash table contains the actual counts of the candidate $k+1$ itemsets. Hence we do not need to make extra processing to count the occurrences of candidate $k+1$ itemsets as in the DHP algorithm. The algorithm also prunes the database at each step in order to reduce the search space. We also tested our algorithm with real datasets obtained from a large retailing company and observed that our algorithm performs better than the Apriori algorithm.},

The characteristics of text databases are quite different from those of retail transaction databases, and existing mining algorithms cannot handle text databases efficiently because of the large number of itemsets (i.e., words) that need to be counted. Two well-known mining algorithms, Apriori algorithm and Direct Hashing and Pruning (DHP) algorithm, are evaluated in the context of mining text databases, and are compared with the new proposed algorithms named Multipass-Apriori (M-Apriori) and Multipass-DHP (M-DHP).

	Abstract = {Discovery of association rules is an important database mining problem. Current algorithms for finding association rules require several passes over the analyzed database, and obviously the role of I/O overhead is very significant for very large databases. We present new algorithms that reduce the database activity considerably. The idea is to pick a random sample, to find using this sample all association rules that probably hold in the whole database, and then to verify the results with the rest of the database. The algorithms thus produce exact association rules, not approximations based on a sample. The approach is, however, probabilistic, and in those rare cases where our sampling method does not produce all association rules, the missing rules can be found in a second pass. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithms can find association rules very efficiently in only one database pass.},

We illustrate our ideas by investigating the use of a dbms for a well-researched area: the discovery of association rules. We present a simple algorithm, consisting of only union and intersection operations, and show that it achieves quite good performance on an efficient dbms.

Our method can incorporate inheritance hierarchies to the association rule algorithm easily. We also present a technique that effectively reduces the number of database operations when searching large search spaces that contain only few interesting items.

Our work shows that database techniques are promising for data mining: general architectures can achieve reasonable results.},

Algorithm SETM uses only simple database primitives, viz., sorting and merge-scan join. Algorithm SETM is simple, fast, and stable over the mnge of pammeter values. The major contribution of this paper is that it shows that at least some aspects of data mining can be carried out by using general query languages such as SQL, mther than by developing specialized black box algorithms.

Compared to the previous algorithms, our algorithm reduces both CPU and I/O overheads. In our experimental study it was found that for large databases, the CPU overhead was reduced by as much as a factor of seven and I/O was reduced by almost an order of magnitude. Hence this algorithm is especially suitable for very large size databases. The algorithm is also ideally suited for parallelization.

	Abstract = {Association rules are statments of the form ``98\% of the customers that purchase tires and automobile accessories also get automotive services''. We consider the problem of discovering association rules between items in large databases. We present two new algorithms for solving this problem. Experiments with synthetic data show that these algorithms outperform previous algorithms by factor ranging from three for small problems to more than an order of magnitude for large problems. We show how the best of the two proposed algorithms can be combined into a hybrid algorithm. Scale-up experiments show that the hybrid algorithm scales linearly with the number of transactions and that it has excellent scale-up properties with respect to the transaction size and the number of items in the database. We also give simple information theoretic lower bounds for the problem of finding association rules, and show that sampling can be in some cases an efficient way of finding such rules.},

Agrawal, Imielinski, and Swami introduced the problem of mining association rules from large collections of data, and gave a method based on successive passes over the database. We give an improved algorithm for the problem. The method is based on careful combinatorial analysis of the information obtained in previous passes; this makes it possible to eliminate unnecessary candidate rules.

The existence of highly frequent items adds significantly to the cost of computing the complete set of frequent itemsets. Our approach allows for the exclusion of such items during the candidate generation phase of the Apriori algorithm. Afterwards, the highly frequent items can be reintroduced, via an inferencing framework, providing for a capability to generate frequent itemsets without counting their frequency.\\ We demonstrate the use of these new techniques within the well-studied framework of the Apriori algorithm. Furthermore, we provide empirical results using our techniques on both synthetic and real datasets - both relevant since the real datasets exhibit statistical characteristics diferent from the probabilistic assumptions behind the synthetic data. The source we used for real data was the U.S. Census.},

	Abstract = {We introduce the problem of mining generalized association rules. Given a large database of transactions, where each transaction consists of a set of items, and a taxonomy (is-a hierarchy) on the items, we find associations between items at any level of the taxonomy. For example, given a taxonomy that says that jackets is-a outerwear is-a clothes, we may infer a rule that ``people who buy outerwear tend to buy shoes''. This rule may hold even if rules that ``people who buy jackets tend to buy shoes'', and ``people who buy clothes tend to buy shoes'' do not hold. An obvious solution to the problem is to add all ancestors of each item in a transaction to the transaction, and then run any of the algorithms for mining association rules on these ``extended transactions''. However, this ``Basic'' algorithm is not very fast; we present two algorithms, Cumulate and EstMerge, which run 2 to 5 times faster than Basic (and more than 100 times faster on one real-life dataset). We also present a new interest-measure for rules which uses the information in the taxonomy. Given a user-specified ``minimum-interest-level'', this measure prunes a large number of redudant rules; 40\% to 60\% of all the rules were pruned on two real-life datasets.},

	Abstract = {One of the most well-studied problems in data mining is mining for association rules in market basket data. Association rules, whose significance is measured via support and confidence, are intended to identify rules of the type, ``A customer purchasing item $A$ often also purchases item $B$.'' Motivated by the goal of generalizing beyond market baskets and the association rules used with them, we develop the notion of mining rules that identify correlations (generalizing associations), and we consider both the absence and presence of items as a basis for generating rules. We propose measuring significance of associations via the chi-squared test for correlation from classical statistics. This leads to a measure that is upward closed in the itemset lattice, enabling us to reduce the mining problem to the search for a border between correlated and uncorrelated itemsets in the lattice. We develop pruning strategies and devise an efficient algorithm for the resulting problem. We demonstrate its effectiveness by testing it on census data and finding term dependence in a corpus of text documents, as well as on synthetic data.},

The rules that are derived from ANN are needed to be formed to solve this problem and various methods have been improved to extract these rules. In our previous works Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) algorithm has been used to extract rules from trained ANN and has been applied to various databases [11, 41-43]. In this study, association rules have been composed using Apriori algorithm and transactions, which provide these rules, were eliminated. This provides shrinking database.

@article{ThabtahCowlingHammoud-ImprovingRuleSorting-2006,
	Abstract = {Traditional classification techniques such as decision trees and RIPPER use heuristic search methods to find a small subset of patterns. In recent years, a promising new approach that mainly uses association rule mining in classification called associative classification has been proposed. Most associative classification algorithms adopt the exhaustive search method presented in the famous Apriori algorithm to discover the rules and require multiple passes over the database. Furthermore, they find frequent items in one phase and generate the rules in a separate phase consuming more resources such as storage and processing time. In this paper, a new associative classification method called Multi-class Classification based on Association Rules (MCAR) is presented. MCAR takes advantage of vertical format representation and uses an efficient technique for discovering frequent items based on recursively intersecting the frequent items of size n to find potential frequent items of size nC1. Moreover, since rule ranking plays an important role in classification and the majority of the current associative classifiers like CBA and CMAR select rules mainly in terms of their confidence levels. MCAR aims to improve upon CBA and CMAR approaches by adding a more tie breaking constraints in order to limit random selection. Finally we show that shuffling the training data objects before mining can impact substantially the prediction power of some well known associative classification techniques. After experimentation with 20 different data sets, the results indicate that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive in term of an error rate and efficiency if compared with decision trees, rule induction methods and other popular associative classification methods. Finally, we show the effectiveness of MCAR rule sorting method on the quality of the produced classifiers for 12 highly dense benchmark problems.},

In response, we investigate the problem of index page synthesis --- the automatic creation of pages that facilitate a visitor's navigation of a Web site. Previous work has employed statistical methods to generate candidate index pages that are of limited value because they do not correspond to concepts or topics that are intuitive to people. In this paper we formalize index page synthesis as a conceptual clustering problem and introduce a novel approach which we call {\em conceptual cluster mining}: we search for a small number of cohesive clusters that correspond to concepts in a given concept description language $L$.\\ Next, we present SCML, an algorithm schema that combines a statistical clustering algorithm with a concept learning algorithm. The clustering algorithm is used to generate seed clusters, and the concept learning algorithm to describe these seed clusters using expressions in $L$. Finally, we offer preliminary experimental form existing algorithms (e.g., COBWEB) in this domain.},

Logs of user accesses to a site provide an opportunity to observe users interacting with that site and make improvements to the site's structure and presentation. We propose adaptive sites: web sites that improve themselves by learning from user access patterns. Adaptive webs can make popular pages more accessible, highlight interesting links, connect related pages, and cluster similar documents together. An adaptive web can perform these self-improvements autonomously or advise a site's webmaster, summarizing access information and making suggestions.

	Abstract = {Discovering frequent itemsets is a key problem in important data mining applications, such as the discovery of association rules, strong rules, episodes, and minimal keys. Typical algorithms for solving this problem operate in a bottom-up, breadth-first search direction. The computation starts from frequent 1-itemsets (the minimum length frequent itemsets) and continues until all maximal (length) frequent itemsets are found. During the execution, every frequent itemset is explicitly considered. Such algorithms perform well when all maximal frequent itemsets are short. However, performance drastically deteriorates when some of the maximal frequent itemsets are long. We present a new algorithm which combines both the bottom-up and the top-down searches. The primary search direction is still bottom-up, but a restricted search is also conducted in the top-down direction. This search is used only for maintaining and updating a new data structure, the maximum frequent candidate set. It is used to prune early candidates that would be normally encountered in the bottom-up search. A very important characteristic of the algorithm is that it does not require explicit examination of every frequent itemset. Therefore, the algorithm performs well even when some maximal frequent itemsets are long. As its output, the algorithm produces the maximum frequent set, i.e., the set containing all the maximal frequent itemsets, thus specifying inmediately all frequent itemsets.We evaluate the performance of the algorithm using well-known synthetic benchmark databases, real-life census, and stock market databases. The improvement in performance can be up to several orders of magnitude, compared to the best previous algorithms.},

Most of conventional data mining algorithms identify the relation among transactions with binary values. Transactions with quantitative values are, however, commonly seen in real world applications. In the past, we proposed a fuzzy mining algorithm based on the Apriori approach to explore interesting knowledge from the transactions with quantitative values. This paper proposes another new fuzzy mining algorithm based on the AprioriTid approach to find fuzzy association rules from given quantitative transactions. Each item uses only the linguistic term with the maximum cardinality in later mining processes, thus making the number of fuzzy regions to be processed the same as that of the original items. The algorithm therefore focuses on the most important linguistic terms for reduced time complexity. Experimental results from the data in a supermarket of a department store show the feasibility of the proposed mining algorithm.},

@phdthesis{Tesis_Liu_SupportingEfficientAndScalableFrequentPatternMining_2005,
	Abstract = {With the large amount of data collected in various applications, data mining has become an essential tool for data analysis and decision support. Frequent itemset mining is an important problem in the data mining area with a wide range of applications. In this dissertation, we investigate several techniques to support efficient and scalable frequent itemset mining.
We first identify the key factors of a frequent itemset mining algorithm, and propose an algorithm AFOPT for efficient mining of frequent itemsets. The AFOPT algorithm adopts the pattern growth approach. It uses a new structure, called Ascending Frequency Ordered Prefix-Tree (or AFOPT for short), and two other structures to store conditional databases. An adaptive strategy is employed to choose proper structures according to the density of the conditional databases, which makes the AFOPT algorithm perform well on both sparse and dense databases.
To deal with very large databases with millions of transactions, we propose a Search Space based Partitioning approach SSP for scalable out-of-core mining. The novel idea of SSP is to partition the database based on the search space. Different partitions share data but not frequents itemsets. As such, frequent itemsets can be mined from each partition without the need to scan the whole database to verify their support. Furthermore, techniques are developed so that the available memory can be utilized during the mining process to minimize disk I/O. Our experiment results show that the proposed algorithms achieve significant performance improvement over existing out-of-core mining algorithms.
Many decision support systems need to support online interactive frequent itemset mining, which is very challenging because frequent itemset mining is a computation intensive repetitive process. We propose a compact disk-based data structure CFP-tree (Condensed Frequent Pattern tree) for storing precomputed frequent itemsets to support online mining requests. Efficient algorithms for retrieving frequent itemsets and association rules from a CFP-tree, as well as efficien algorithms to construct and update a CFP-tree, are developed. One obstacle to online association rule mining is the undesirably large result size. We introduce the concepto of frequent itemset class and the class association rule to reduce the result size without information loss. The benefits of organizing itemsets into classes are two-fold. On the one hand, the output size is reduced and is easier for users to browse the results. On the other hand, the computation cost is saved because the rule generation cost of the itemsets in the same class is shared. Our performance study demonstrates that with CFP-tree and the concept of frequent itemset class, frequent itemset and association rule mining request can be responded to promptly.},

@inproceedings{LiuLiZhangTang_OptimizationOfFIMOnMultipleCoreProcessor_2007,
	Abstract = {Multi-core processors are proliferated across different domains in recent years. In this paper, we study the performance of frequent pattern mining on a modern multi-core machine. A detailed study shows that, even with the best implementation, current FP-tree based algorithms still under-utilize a multi-core system due to poor data locality and insufficient parallelism expression. We propose two techniques: a cache-conscious FP-array (frequent pattern array) and a lock-free dataset tiling parallelization mechanism to address this problem. The FP-array efficiently improves the data locality performance, and makes use of the benefits from hardware and software prefetching. The result yields an overall 4.0 speedup compared with the state-of-the-art implementation. Furthermore, to unlock the power of multi-core processor, a lock-free parallelization approach is proposed to restructure the FP-tree building algorithm. It not only eliminates the locks in building a single FP-tree with fine-grained threads, but also improves the temporal data locality performance. To summarize, with the proposed cache-conscious FP-array and lock-free parallelization enhancements, the overall FP-tree algorithm achieves a 24 fold speedup on an 8-core machine. Finally, we believe the presented techniques can be applied to other data mining tasks as well with the prevalence of multi-core processor.},

@article{DongHan_BitTableFIEfficientFIMalg2007,
	Abstract = {Mining frequent itemsets in transaction databases, time-series databases and many other kinds of databases is an important task and has been studied popularly in data mining research. The problem of mining frequent itemsets can be solved by constructing a candidate set of itemsets first, and then, identifying those itemsets that meet the frequent itemset requirement within this candidate set. Most of the previous research mainly focuses on pruning to reduce the candidate itemsets amounts and the times of scanning databases. However, many algorithms adopt an Apriori-like candidate itemsets generation and support count approach that is the most time-wasted process. To address this issue, the paper proposes an effective algorithm named as BitTableFI. In the algorithm, a special data structure BitTable is used horizontally and vertically to compress database for quick candidate itemsets generation and support count, respectively. The algorithm can also be used in many Apriori-like algorithms to improve the performance. Experiments with both synthetic and real databases show that BitTableFI outperforms Apriori and CBAR which uses ClusterTable for quick support count.},

	Abstract = {Rule induction research implicitly assumes that after producing the rules from a dataset, these rules will be used directly by an expert system or a human user. In real-life applications, the situation may not be as simple as that, particularly, when the user of the rules is a human being. The human user almost always has some previous concepts or knowledge about the domain represented by the dataset. Naturally, he/she wishes to know how the new rules compare with his/her existing knowledge. In dynamic domains where the rules may change over time, it is important to know what the changes are. These aspects of research have largely been ignored in the past. With the increasing use of machine learning techniques in practical applications such as data mining, this issue of post analysis of rules warrants greater emphasis and attention. In this paper, we propose a technique to deal with this problem. A system has been implemented to perform the post analysis of classification rules generated by systems such as C4.5. The proposed technique is general and highly interactive. It will be particularly useful in data mining and data analysis.},

	Abstract = {Classification rule mining aims to discover a small set of rules in the database that forms an accurate classifier. Association rule mining finds all the rules existing in the database that satisfy some minimum support and minimum confidence constraints. For association rule mining, the target of discovery is not pre-determined, while for classification rule mining there is one and only one predetermined target. In this paper, we propose to integrate these two mining techniques. The integration is done by focusing on mining a special subset of association rules, called class association rules (CARs). An efficient algorithm is also given for building a classifier based on the set of discovered CARs. Experimental results show that the classifier built this way is, in general, more accurate than that produced by the state-of-the-art classification system C4.5. In addition, this integration helps to solve a number of problems that exist in the current classification systems.},

	Abstract = {Association rule mining is an important model in data mining. Its mining algorithms discover all item associations (or rules) in the data that satisfy the user-specified minimum support (minsup) and minimum confidence (minconf) constraints. Minsup controls the minimum number of data cases that a rule must cover. Minconf controls the predictive strength of the rule. Since only one minsup is used for the whole database, the model implicitly assumes that all items in the data are of the same nature and/or have similar frequencies in the data. This is, however, seldom the case in reallife applications. In many applications, some items appear very frequently in the data, while others rarely appear. If minsup is set too high, those rules that involve rare items will not be found. To find rules that involve both frequent and rare items, minsup has to be set very low. This may cause combinatorial explosion because those frequent items will be associated with one another in all possible ways. This dilemma is called the rare item problem. This paper proposes a novel technique to solve this problem. The technique allows the user to specify multiple minimum supports to reflect the natures of the items and their varied frequencies in the database. In rule mining, different rules may need to satisfy different minimum supports depending on what items are in the rules. Experiment results show that the technique is very effective.},

@article{TsayHsuYu_FIUTaNewMethodForFIM_2009,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient method, the frequent items ultrametric trees (FIUT), for mining frequent itemsets in a database. FIUT uses a special frequent items ultrametric tree (FIU-tree) structure to enhance its efficiency in obtaining frequent itemsets. Compared to related work, FIUT has four major advantages. First, it minimizes I/O overhead by scanning the database only twice. Second, the FIU-tree is an improved way to partition a database, which results from clustering transactions, and significantly reduces the search space. Third, only frequent items in each transaction are inserted as nodes into the FIU-tree for compressed storage. Finally, all frequent itemsets are generated by checking the leaves of each FIU-tree, without traversing the tree recursively, which significantly reduces computing time. FIUT was compared with FP-growth, a well-known and widely used algorithm, and the simulation results showed that the FIUT outperforms the FP-growth. In addition, further extensions of this approach and their implications are discussed.},

	Abstract = {A well-known problem that limits the practical usage of association rule mining algorithms is the extremely large number of rules generated. Such a large number of rules makes the algorithms inefficient and makes it difficult for the end users to comprehend the discovered rules. We present the concept of a heavy itemset. An itemset $A$ is heavy (for given support and confidence values) if all possible association rules made up of items only in $A$ are present. We prove a simple necessary and sufficient condition for an itemset to be heavy. We present a formula for the number of possible rules for a given heavy itemset, and show that a heavy itemset compactly represents an exponential number of association rules. Along with two simple search algorithms, we present an efficient greedy algorithm to generate a collection of disjoint heavy itemsets in a given transaction database. We then present a modified apriori algorithm that starts with a given collection of disjoint heavy itemsets and discovers more heavy itemsets, not necessarily disjoint with the given ones.},

The mining of association rules can be mapped into the problem of discovering large itemsets where a large itemset is a group of items which appear in a sufficient number of transactions.

To determine large itemsets from a huge number of candidate large itemsets in early iterations is usually the dominating factor for the overall data mining performance. To address this issue, we propose an effective hash-based algorithm for the candidate set generation. Explicitly, the number of candidate 2-itemsets generated by the proposed algorithm is, in orders of magnitude, smaller than that by previous methods, thus resolving the performance bottleneck. Note that the generation of smaller candidate sets enables us to effectively trim the transaction database size at a much earlier stage of the iterations, thereby reducing the computational cost for later iterations significantly.

Unlike standard timeout methods, which use fixed time thresholds for session identification, we use an information theoretic approach which yields more robust results for identifying session boundaries. We evaluate our new approach by learning interesting association rules from the segmented session files. We then compare the performance of our approach to three standard session identification methods - the standard timeout method, the reference length method and the maximal forward reference method - and find that our statistical language modeling approach generally yields superior results. However, as with every method, the performance of our technique varies with changing parameter settings. Therefore, we also analyze the influence of the two key factors in our language modeling based approach: the choice of smoothing technique and the language model order. We find that all standard smoothing techniques, save one, perform well, and that performance is robust to language model order.},

	Abstract = {Detecting session boundaries on the Web is important for several reasons. Firstly, it is important to establish a common context for various statistics relating to user sessions and frequency of user activities. More specifically, it is important to detect some boundaries in order to group related information together for other applications, such as learning techniques for adaptive search engines.\\ To date, however, the notion of a session on the Web has not been consistently defined, if it at all. The tendency has been to group the log data that has been made available from one user or IP address under the umbrella of one session regardless of the length of time covered by the logs. This tendency lacks a more user oriented view. Our argument is that a session on the Web can be defined as a group of user activities that are related to each other not only through an evolving information need but also through close proximity in time. Thus, we describe and discuss the investigation based on two Web transaction logs (Excite and Altavista) with a view to structuring the activities into sessions or units for subsequent use in user-oriented learning techniques.\\ The paper describes the methodology and the experiments performed followed by results and discussions. The results point to a 10-15 minute threshold between user activities for an appropriate session interval. The implications and limitations of the results as well as differences with traditional IR systems are also discussed.},

Our performance study shows that the FP-growth method is efficient and scalable for mining both long and short frequent patterns, and is about an order of magnitude faster than the Apriori algorithm and also faster than some recently reported new frequent-pattern mining methods},

	Abstract = {Recommender systems are widely used to help deal with the problem of information overload. However, recommenders raise serious privacy and security issues. The personal information collected by recommenders raises the risk of unwanted exposure of that information. Also, malicious users can bias or sabotage the recommendations that are provided to other users. This paper raises important research questions in three topics relating to exposure and bias in recommender systems: the value and risks of the preference information shared with a recommender, the effectiveness of shilling attacks designed to bias a recommender, and the issues involved in distributed or peer-to-peer recommenders. The goal of the paper is to bring these questions to the attention of the information and communication security community, to invite their expertise in addressing them.},

	Abstract = {Association rule discovery has emerged as an important problem in knowledge discovery and data mining. The association mining task consists of identifying the frequent itemsets, and then forming conditional implication rules among them. In this paper we present efficient algorithms for the discovery of frequent itemsets, which forms the compute intensive phase of the task. The algorithms utilize the structural properties of frequent itemsets to facilitate fast discovery. The related database items are grouped together into clusters representing the potential maximal frequent itemsets in the database. Each cluster induces a sub-lattice of the itemset lattice. Efficient lattice traversal techniques are presented, which quickly identify all the true maximal frequent itemsets, and all their subsets if desired. We also present the effect of using different database layout schemes combined with the proposed clustering and traversal techniques. The proposed algorithms scan a (pre-processed) database only once, addressing the open question in association mining, whether all the rules can be efficiently extracted in a single database pass. We experimentally compare the new algorithms against the previous approaches, obtaining improvements of more than an order of magnitude for our test databases.},

We also show how the best features of the two proposed algorithms can be combined into a hybrid algorithm, called AprioriHybrid. Scale-up experiments show that AprioriHybrid scales linearly with the number of transactions. AprioriHybrid also has excellent scale-up properties with respect to the transaction size and the number of items in the database.},

	Abstract = {Mining high utility itemsets from databases is an emerging topic in data mining, which refers to the discovery of itemsets with utilities higher than a user-specified minimum utility threshold min_util. Although several studies have been carried out on this topic, setting an appropriate minimum utility threshold is a difficult problem for users. If min_util is set too low, too many high utility itemsets will be generated, which may cause the mining algorithms to become inefficient or even run out of memory. On the other hand, if min_util is set too high, no high utility itemset will be found. Setting appropriate minimum utility thresholds by trial and error is a tedious process for users. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a new framework named top-k high utility itemset mining, where k is the desired number of high utility itemsets to be mined. An efficient algorithm named TKU (Top-K Utility itemsets mining) is proposed for mining such itemsets without setting min_util. Several features were designed in TKU to solve the new challenges raised in this problem, like the absence of anti-monotone property and the requirement of lossless results. Moreover, TKU incorporates several novel strategies for pruning the search space to achieve high efficiency. Results on real and synthetic datasets show that TKU has excellent performance and scalability.},

Given a sequence of itemsets, we have to find itemsets that are contained as a subset in more than a given number of elements of the sequence. More than 180 papers have been published about algorithms to solve this task, most of them declared to be the most efficient. The open-source competition, wich was organized ten years after the problem's birth, proved that the truth is far from the claims and the data structure and implementation issues need to be polished even for the basic algorithms.\\ In this survey we investigate data structure and implementation details of the three most important FIM algorithms Apirori, Eclat, FP-growth, examine their advantages and disavantages. Besides, we present new techniques to speed-up the basic algorithms.},

Ideas that seem to be quite promising, may turn out to be ineffective if we descend to the implementation level.\\ We theoretically and experimentally analyze APRIORI which is the most established algorithm for frequent itemset mining. Several implementations of the algorithm have been put forward in the last decade. Although they are implementations of the very same algorithm, they display large differences in running time and memory need. In this paper we describe an implementation of APRIORI that outperforms all implementations known to us. We analyze, theoretically and experimentally, the principal data structure of our solution. This data structure is the main factor in the efficiency of our implementation. Moreover, we present a simple modification of APRIORI that appears to be faster than the original algorithm.},

@article{BucklinSismeiro-AModelOfWebSiteBrowsing-2001,
	Abstract = {The authors develop and estimate a model of the browsing behavior of visitors to a web site using the clickstream data recorded in web server logfiles. Two aspects of browsing behavior are examined: (1) the visitor's decisions to continue browsing (by submitting an additional page request) or to exit the site and (2) the length of time spent viewing each page. A binary probit model captures the decisions of each visitor either to continue browsing or to leave the site. A proportional hazards model captures the duration of each page view. The two models can be estimated separately or linked together to form a joint expression, thereby allowing the page request/exit decision to affect page view duration.The joint probit and hazard model was fitted to the browsing decisions of a random sample of 5,000 visitors to the web site of an Internet automotive company. Information on page requests, page view durations, and several covariates was extracted from web server log files.The model was estimated using Bayesian methods to account for cross-sectional heterogeneityin parameters.The empirical results show that visitors' propensity to continue browsing changes dynamically as a function of the depth of a given site visit and the number of repeat visits to the site. The dynamics are consistent with ``within-site lock-in'' or site ``stickiness'' and with learning that carries over repeated visits. The results also reveal browsing patterns that may reflect time-saving strategies developed by visitors. These strategies involve dynamic on-line adjustments of page view duration and visit depth. Finally, the results suggest that users with more severe time constraints also learn faster across multiple site visits. In addition to the insights into browsing behavior, the study also produces several implications for web site managers. First, simple site metrics computed at the aggregate level are shown to diverge substantially from the individual-level modeling results, indicating the need for analysts to control for cross-sectional heterogeneity. Second, adding more information per page does not drive users away and can enable them to complete tasks with fewer page views. Lastly, attempts to customize web sites that slow or interfere with across-visit learning could raise the implicit costs of site usage and thereby lead to more site exits prior to task completions.},

@article{BorgesLevene-DataMiningOfUserNavigationPatterns-1999,
	Abstract = {The continuous growth in the size and use of the World Wide Web is creating difficulties in both the design of web sites to suit a variety of different users and in the navigation through very large web structures of pages and links. We propose a data mining model that captures the user navigation behaviour patterns. The set of user navigation sessions, which characterize the interaction with the web pages visited, are modelled as a hypertext probabilistic grammar, whose higher probability generated strings correspond to the user's preferred trails. An algorithm to efficiently mine such trails is given. We make use of the $N$-grammar model which assumes that, when the user is browsing a given page, the last $N$ pages browsed affect the probability of the next page to be visited. The model is based on the well established theory of probabilistic grammars providing it with a sound theoretical foundation for future enhancements. Moreover, we propose the use of entropy as an estimator of the statistical properties of the grammar. Extensive experiments with both real and random data were conducted and the results show that, in practice, our algorithm runs in linear time in the size of the grammar. Our experiments also show that the entropy of the grammar is a good estimator of the number of mined trails and the results from the experiments with the real data confirm the effectiveness of our model.},

@phdthesis{Anderson-AMachineLearningApproachToWebPersonalization-2002,
	Abstract = {Most web sites today are designed one-size-fits-all: all visitors see the exact same pages regardless of interests, previous interactions, or, frequently, even browsing client (desktop PC or wireless PDA). But one size often does not fit all. Instead of presenting the same content, the web experience should be dynamic and personalized, adapting to visitors' preferences as evinced in previous interactions.\\ This thesis proposes a framework for personalizing the web experience. Within our PROTEUS framework, we view personalization as a two-step process of first modeling users, and then improving the site given the model. We frame this problem as a machine learning task: the goal is to predict users' web navigation given their previous behavior. We explore several means of personalization, including improving the wireless web and building personalized, dynamic portals, and concentrate on one in particular-automatically adding shortcuts to likely navigation destinations.\\ A challenge in modeling web navigation is that training data for an entire site may be plentiful, but sparse for any individual page. This difficulty can be overcome, however, by noting that most large web sites have a rich underlying relational structure that can be exploited for generalization: pages can belong to different types (e.g., pages about laptop computers versus pages about printers), with each type described by a different set of attributes (e.g., size of display versus printing speed).},

@article{CooleyMobasherSrivastava_DataPreparationForMiningWWWBrowsingPatterns_1999,
	Abstract = {The World Wide Web (WWW) continues to grow at an astounding rate in both the sheer volume of traffic and the size and complexity of Web sites. The complexity of tasks such as Web site design, Web server design, and of simply navigating through a Web site have increased along with this growth. An important input to these design tasks is the analysis of how a Web site is being used. Usage analysis includes straightforward statistics, such as page access frequency, as well as more sophisticated forms of analysis, such as finding the common traversal paths through a Web site. Web Usage Mining is the application of data mining techniques to usage logs of large Web data repositorioes in order to produce results that can be used in the design tasks mentioned above. However, there are several preprocessing tasks that must be performed prior to applying data mining algorithms to the data collected from server logs. This paper presents several data preparation techniques in order to identify unique users and user sessions. Also, a method to divide user sessions into semantically meaningful transactions is defined and successfully tested against two other methods. Transactions identified by the proposed methods are used to discover association rules from real world data using the WEBMINER system [15].},

However, there is no stablished vocabulary, lading to confusion when comparing research efforts. The term Web mining has been used in two distintict ways. The first, called Web content mining in this paper, is the process of information discovery from sources across the Worl Wide Web. The second, called Web Usage Mining, is the process of mining for user browsing and access patterns. In this paper we define Web mining and presenta an overview of the various research issues, techniques, and development efforts. We briefly describe WEBMINER, a system for Web usage mining, and conclude this paper by listing research issues.},

@article{DeBraAroyoChepegin_NextBigThingAdaptiveWebBasedSystems_2004,
	Abstract = {At the ACM Hypertext Conference a panel discussed ``The Next Big Thing Inc.'' in the area of hypertext and hypermedia. The Web has been the ``Big Thing'' during the past 10 years, but its success has also made it very difficult to find the appropriate information in an ocean of over 3 billion pages. Whereas search engines achieve incredible precision, they suffer from the same ``one size fits all'' approach that characterizes the Web sites they index. The paper defends the position that personalization, and in particular automatic personalization or adaptation, is the key to reach the goal of offering each individual user (or user group) the information they need. During the panel discussion there was debate about whether the user should always have access and control over the entire (hypertextual) information space. There were different views on whether the ``right'' to all the information is best guaranteed by offering tools that reduce the information space the user perceives so that the user can actually find and reach the information, or by offering unfiltered access to an ocean of information in which everything is available but in which perhaps nothing can be found. We argue in favor of adaptation but at the same time point out flaws in the way adaptive hypermedia has been used until now. The paper then proposes a new, modular adaptive hypermedia architecture that should lead to adaptive Web-based systems as the ``Next Big Thing'' indeed. In this architecture, different applications can collaborate in creating and updating a user model. Shared user model servers are not just needed for adaptive Web sites, but are also the key to enabling the development of ambient intelligence. (Many small systems then need to work together and base their actions on common knowledge about their user(s).) Sharing user models can of course cause a ``big brother'' problem. Legislation is already in place to protect users' privacy by placing legal limits on the kind of user modeling and sharing of user models that is allowed. The paper briefly reviews the legal issues of user modeling and adaptation in order to provide not just a future outlook based on ``wild imagination'' but based on a realistic vision of what will not only become technically possible but also of what will be ``acceptable''.},

	Abstract = {This article considers the question: is effective Web mining possible?\\ Skeptics believe that the Web is too unstructured for Web mining to succeed. Indeed, data mining has been applied to databases traditionally, yet much of the information on the Web lies buried in documents designed for human consumption such as home pages or product catalogs. Furthermore, much of the information on the Web is presented in natural language text with no machine-readable semantics; HTML annotations structure the {\em display} of Web pages, but provide little insight into their {\em content}.\\ Some have advocated transforming the Web into a massive layered database to facilitate data mining [12], but the Web is too dynamic and chaotic to be tamed in this manner. Others have attempted to hand code site-specific ``wrappers'' that facilitate the extraction of information from individual Web resources (e.g., [8]). Hand coding is convenient but cannot keep up with the explosive growth of the Web. As an alternative, this article argues for the:\\ \textbf{Structured Web Hypothesis:} {\em Information on the Web is sufficiently structured to facilitate effective Web mining.} \ldots},

@inproceedings{Friedman-DataMiningAndStatisticsWhatIsTheConnection-1997,
	Abstract = {Data Mining is used to discover patterns and relationships in data, with an emphasis on large observational data bases. It sits at the common frontiers of several fields including Data Base Management, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, and Data Visualization. From a statistical perspective it can be viewed as computer automated exploratory data analysis of (usually) large complex data sets. In spite of (or perhaps because of) the somewhat exaggerated hype, this field is having a major impact in business, industry, and science. It also affords enormous research opportunities for new methodological developments. Despite the obvious connections between data mining and statistical data analysis, most of the methodologies used in Data Mining have so far originated in fields other than Statistics. This paper explores some of the reasons for this, and why statisticians should have an interest in Data Mining. It is argued that Statistics can potentially have a major influence on Data Mining, but in order to do so some of our basic paradigms and operating principles may have to be modified.},

@inproceedings{HeGoker_DetectingSessionBoundariesFromWebUsersLogs_2000,
	Abstract = {Detecting session boundaries on the Web is important for several reasons. Firstly, it is important to establish a common context for various statistics relating to user sessions and frequency of user activities. More specifically, it is important to detect some boundaries in order to group related information together for other applications, such as learning techniques for adaptive search engines.\\ To date, however, the notion of a session on the Web has not been consistently defined, if it at all. The tendency has been to group the log data that has been made available from one user or IP address under the umbrella of one session regardless of the length of time covered by the logs. This tendency lacks a more user oriented view. Our argument is that a session on the Web can be defined as a group of user activities that are related to each other not only through an evolving information need but also through close proximity in time. Thus, we describe and discuss the investigation based on two Web transaction logs (Excite and Altavista) with a view to structuring the activities into sessions or units for subsequent use in user-oriented learning techniques.\\ The paper describes the methodology and the experiments performed followed by results and discussions. The results point to a 10-15 minute threshold between user activities for an appropriate session interval. The implications and limitations of the results as well as differences with traditional IR systems are also discussed.},

We evaluate our new approach by learning interesting association rules from the segmented session files. We then compare the performance of our approach to three standard session identification methods - the standard timeout method, the reference length method, and the maximal forward reference method - and find that our statistical language modeling approach generally yields superior results. However, as with every method, the performance of our technique varies with changing parameter settings. Therefore, we also analyze the influence of the two key factors in our language-modeling-based approach: the choice of smoothing technique and the language model order. We find that all standard smoothing techniques, save one, perform well, and that performance is robust to language model order.},

The Web mining research is at the cross road of research from several research communities, such as database, information retrieval, and within AI, especially the sub-areas of machine learning and natural language processing. However, there is a lot of confusions when comparing research efforts from different point of views. In this paper, we survey the research in the area of Web mining, point out some confusions regarded the usage of the term Web mining and suggest three Web mining categories. Then we situate some of the research with respect to these three categories. We also explore the connection between the Web mining categories and the related agent paradigm. For the survey, we focus on representation issues, on the process, on the learning algorithm, and on the application of the recent works as the criteria. We conclude the paper with some research issues.},

In this paper, we explore whether clustering methods have a role to play in spatial data mining. To this end, we develop a new clustering method called CLARANS which is based on randomized search. We also develop two spatial data mining algorithms that use CLARANS. Our analysis and experiments show that with the assistance of CLARANS, these two algorithms are very effective and can lead to discoveries that are difficult to find with current spatial data mining algorithms.},

The real way to get individualized interaction between a user and a website is to present the user with a variety of options and let the user choose what is of interest to that individual at that specific time. If the information space is designed well, then this choice is easy, and the user achieves optimal information through the use of natural intelligence rather than artificial intelligence. In other words, I am the one entity on the world to know exactly what I need right now. Thus, I can tailor the information I see and the information I skip so that it suits my needs perfectly.},

@article{Pitkow_InSearchOfReliableUsageDataWWW_1997,
	Abstract = {The WWW is currently the hottest testbed for future interactive digital systems. While much is understood technically about how the WWW functions, substantially less is known about how this technology is used collectively and on an individual basis. This disparity of knowledge exists largely as a direct consequence of the decentralized nature of Web. Since each user of the Web is not uniquely identifiable across the system and the system employs various levels of caching, measurement of actual usage is problematic. This paper establishes terminology to frame the problem of reliably determining usage of WWW resources while reviewing current practice and their shortcomings. A review of the various metrics and analyses that can be performed to determine usage is then presented. This is followed by a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the hit-metering proposal [Mogul and Leach 1997] currently in consideration by the HTTP working group. Lastly, new proposals, based upon server-side sampling are introduced and assessed against the other proposal. It is argued that server-side sampling provides more reliable and useful usage data while requiring no change to the current HTTP protocol and enhancing user privacy.},

@inproceedings{SuYangLuZhang_WhatNext_2000,
	Abstract = {As an increasing number of users access information on the web, there is a great opportunity to learn from the server logs to learn about the users' probable actions in the future. In this paper, we present an $n$-gram based model to utilize path profiles of users from very large data sets to predict the users' future requests. Since this is a prediction system, we cannot measure the recall in a traditional sense. We, therefore, present the notion of applicability to give a measure of the ability to predict the next document. Our model is based on a simple extension of existing point-based models for such predictions, but our results show for $n$-gram based prediction when $n$ is greater than three, we can increase precision by 20\% or more for two realistic web logs. Also we present an efficient method that can compress our model to 30\% of its original size so that the model can be loaded in main memory. Our result can potentially be applied to a wide range of applications on the web, including pre-sending, pre-fetching, enhancement of recommendation systems as well as web caching policies. Our tests are based on three realistic web logs. Our algorithm is implemented in a prediction system called WhatNext, which shows a marked improvement in precision and applicability over previous approaches.},

@techreport{Kiran:Reddy:ImprovedMultipleMSBasedAppMineRareAR:09,
	Abstract = {In this paper we have proposed an improved approach to extract rare association rules. Rare association rules are the association rules containing rare items. Rare items are less frequent items. For extracting rare itemsets, the single minimum support (minsup) based approaches like Apriori approach suffer from rare item problem dilemma. At high minsup value, rare itemsets are missed, and at low minsup value, the number of frequent itemsets explodes. To extract rare itemsets, an effort has been made in the literature in which minsup of each item is fixed equal to the percentage of its support. Even though this approach improves the performance over single minsup based approaches, it still suffers from rare item problem dilemma. If minsup for the item is fixed by setting the percentage value high, the rare itemsets are missed as the minsup for the rare items becomes close to their support, and if minsup for the item is fixed by setting the percentage value low, the number of frequent itemsets explodes. In this paper, we propose an improved approach in which minsup is fixed for each item based on the notion of support difference. The proposed approach assigns appropriate minsup values for frequent as well as rare items based on their item supports and reduces both rule missing and rule explosion problems. Experimental results on both synthetic and real world datasets show that the proposed approach improves performance over existing approaches by minimizing the explosion of number of frequent itemsets involving frequent items and without missing the frequent itemsets involving rare items.},
